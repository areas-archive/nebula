## Instructions

Create a personal repository that will contain all your changes in a new branch. You may clone this repository if you would like, but please don't fork and submit a pull request (PR) to this repository. If you need guidance in cloning a repository, check out the [Clone a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide from GitHub.

The file in this folder, [assignment](assignment.md), contains text that is intended to go to a documentation reference page. Your task is to improve the text and help improve the reading experience. You have the freedom to change everything you feel is needed. This includes adding or removing content and changing the markdown elements such as headings, links, titles, images, and code snippets. Make the changes you feel improve the quality of the text and the learning experience. We ask that all changes comply with the [style guide](/style_guide.md) provided.

Create a pull request (PR) in your repository when you have completed all the changes and are satisfied with the results. Email a link to the PR to the person you have been in contact with throughout the hiring process. Ensure the repository has public access so the hiring manager can review the PR.

## Assumptions
- The reader has basic knowledge of Kubernetes.
- The current text is a draft, you are a technical writer that has been tasked with improving the text and content.
- You can use Gitlab, GitHub, Bitbucket, or any other versioning control system to host your deliverable.

## Tips

- Create a new git branch before making any changes.

- Carefully review the [style guide](../style_guide.md).

- Use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and its features.

- Review grammar and language. Writing content that is littered with typos and awkward language results in a poor reader experience.

- Review your final changes with fresh eyes after some time has passed to catch language, flow, and typos.
