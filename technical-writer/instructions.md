The file in this folder, [assignment](assignment.md), contains text that is intended to go to a documentation reference page. Your task is to improve the text and help improve the reading experience. You have the freedom to change everything you feel is needed. This includes adding or removing content and changing the markdown elements such as headings, links, titles, images, and code snippets. Make the changes you feel improve the quality of the text and the learning experience.  We ask that all changes comply with the style guide provided.

Create a pull request (PR) in your repository when you have completed all the changes and are satisfied with the results. Email a link to the PR to the person you have been in contact with throughout the hiring process. Ensure the repository has public access so the hiring manager can review the PR.
